Welcome to my digital ether! My name is Dieu My (pronounced 'dew mai';
funnily, 'dieu' is 'god' in French – my parents are unwitting and ironic heretics).
I am currently in the 20th grade at
the University of Colorado Boulder. In the Computer Science PhD and the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.colorado.edu/certificate/iqbiology/">IQ Biology</a>
programs here, I study a variety of topics that bridge computer science and biology
in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.peleglab.com">Dr. Orit Peleg's lab</a>. I delve into experimentation in the
world of social insects, particularly the honey bees, that exhibit fascinating
collective behaviors. To further explore their world, I
build agent-based models that show how simple building blocks and rules of
behaviors can allow complex collective patterns to emerge. I also work on and deeply
appreciate machine learning and computer vision approaches that extract and
make sense of big biological data. </p>

<p> In my past life, I had much fun digging into the brains of desert ants and grasshoppers as
a temporary neuroscientist. See my (embarrasingly juvenile but guided by the kind
Dr. Wulfila Gronenberg who motivated my scientific path) undergrad thesis on olfactory learning in ants
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://repository.arizona.edu/handle/10150/613353">here</a>.

In an older past life, I aspired to be a writer. I keep some
old writings here to remind myself of an old fire. </p>

  <p><b>ABSTRACT:</b> Honey bee swarms are a landmark example of collective behavior. To become a coherent swarm, bees locate their queen by tracking her pheromones, but how can distant individuals exploit these chemical signals which decay rapidly in space and time? Here, we combine a novel behavioral assay with the machine vision detection of organism location and scenting behavior to track the search and aggregation dynamics of the honey bee <i>Apis mellifera</i> L. We find that bees collectively create a communication network to propagate pheromone signals, by arranging in a specific spatial distribution where there is a characteristic distance between individuals and a characteristic direction in which individuals broadcast the signals. To better understand such a flow-mediated directional communication strategy, we connect our experimental results to an agent-based model where virtual bees with simple, local behavioral rules, exist in a flow environment. Our model shows that increased directional bias leads to a more efficient aggregation process that avoids local equilibrium configurations of isotropic communication, such as small bee clusters that persist throughout the simulation. Our results highlight a novel example of extended classical stigmergy: rather than depositing static information in the environment, individual bees locally sense and globally manipulate the physical fields of chemical concentration and airflow. </p>
